Raw data collection

Raw data are obtained from UCI Machine Learning repository, using the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.
Activity Recognition (AR) aims to recognize the actions and goals of one or more agents from a series of observations on the agents' actions and the environmental conditions. In the study, the data collectors used a sensor based approach using smartphones as sensing tools. 
The data set was built from experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying) while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually.
The obtained data set has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

Signals
The 3-axial time domain signals from accelerometer and gyroscope were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz.
The signals were sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window at 50 Hz). From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
•	mean(): Mean value
•	std(): Standard deviation
•	mad(): Median absolute deviation 
•	max(): Largest value in array
•	min(): Smallest value in array
•	sma(): Signal magnitude area
•	energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
•	iqr(): Interquartile range 
•	entropy(): Signal entropy
•	arCoeff(): Autoregression coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
•	correlation(): Correlation coefficient between two signals
•	maxInds(): Index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
•	meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
•	skewness(): Skewness of the frequency domain signal 
•	kurtosis(): Kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
•	bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
•	angle(): Angle between some vectors.
No unit of measures is reported as all features were normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

Data transformation
The raw data sets have been processed with run_analisys.R script to create a tidy data set .

Merge training and test sets
Test and training data (X_train.txt, X_test.txt), subject ids (subject_train.txt, subject_test.txt) and activity ids (y_train.txt, y_test.txt) are merged to obtain a single data set. Variables are labelled with the names assigned by original collectors (features.txt).

Extract mean and standard deviation variables
From the merged data set is extracted and intermediate data set with only the values of estimated mean (variables with labels that contain "mean") and standard deviation (variables with labels that contain "std").

Use of Descriptive activity names
A new column is added to intermediate data set with the activity description. Activity id column is used to look up descriptions in activity_labels.txt.

Labeling variables appropriately
Labels given from the original collectors were changed: to obtain valid R names without parentheses, dashes and commas to obtain more descriptive labels

Creating a tidy data set
From the intermediate data set, a final tidy data set is created. The numeric variables are then averaged for each activity and each subject. The tidy data set contains 10299 observations with 81 variables divided in:
•	an activity label (Activity): WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
•	an identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment (Subject): 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30
•	a 79-feature vector with time and frequency domain signal variables (numeric)
