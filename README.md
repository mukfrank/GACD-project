Tidy Part 1
feature names got and subseted to only those features of mean or std measures
Tidy Part 2
the train and test feature sets are got and subset made for only the desired features
Tidy Part 3
the two datasets  are combined into 1
Tidy Part 4
Column names are attached to features
Tidy Part 5
The train and test activity codes are read and combined
Tidy Part 6
Activity labels are got and attached to activity codes
Tidy Part 7
The train and test subject ids are got and combined 
Tidy Part 8
Subjects and activity names are combined and named
Tidy Part 9
Output combined with measures of interest for finished desired data frame
Compute New Result
From the dataset produced, compute and report means of all measures, grouped by subject_id and by activity.
